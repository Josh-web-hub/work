For this project, the blind came to mind when I thought of accessibility. I was reminded 
of my grandfather, of whom when I visited could barely recognize me due to his poor vision.
So I added a text-to-speech audio file that speaks out the content of the website automatically.
In my opinion, for my skill level, this is what I could do to make this website accessible to as
many people as possible.
